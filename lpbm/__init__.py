LPBM Module
===========

This module contains the complete package for lpbm blog generator. Basically,
You will find 3 sub-modules and some helper files:

  * Datas: contains models for the objects the blog manipulates.
  * Modules: contains every module accessible on command line. See --help.
  * Renderers: these classes render different parts of the blog.

Just so you know, v2 is in heavy developpement, so it is broken and I already
know about it. I will release it when I will think it's ready, hopefully
keeping stable and usable.
