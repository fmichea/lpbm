Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Nothing in this FAQ was actually asked, but it may help some people to have
these answers. Anyway you can still ask if you think should be added here.

How is lpbm licensed?
---------------------

lpbm is licensed under ``New BSD License``. You can read its whole source
code, copy it for your own projects and even contribute to it. Have fun!

I found a bug, what do I do?
----------------------------

LPBM has been deprecated, but the old sources are still available. Of course,
I would recommend against continuing to use it, but if you want to because
LPBM filled in a gap, feel free to fork it here: https://github.com/fmichea/lpbm
